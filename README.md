# ZeroOne (Machine City) Simulator

One day while working with [DOSE](https://github.com/mauriceling/dose) simulations, I was thinking of how can I build simulations by parts. That is, how can I add, delete, or amend parts of the simulation as the simulation is executing. This was when I realize that this is very close to an universal simulator. In Matrix Trilogy, the Architect, Oracle, and Merovingian can write new codes send it into the simulator while the simulation is running. This is the simulator that will make things interesting. Hence, I call this project **ZeroOne** (commonly known as Machine City of Matrix Trilogy).
